Lab 3.1 – Simple Datasets and Aggregates

Goals:
- Create and manipulate Python lists and dictionaries.
- Compute aggregates such as sum, average, max, and min.

Instructions:
1. Create a list `temperatures` with daily temperatures for one week.
2. Create a dictionary `city_population` with at least 5 cities and their populations.
3. Compute:
   - The average temperature.
   - The maximum and minimum population.
   - The total population of all cities.
4. Print your results in a clear, formatted way.
